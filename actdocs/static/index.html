<p>
This one-day event will feature two tracks of speakers and will be
held April 14th, 2012, on the campus of CCBC Catonsville. In addition
to a track of speakers discussing innovative, exciting, and fun real
world usage of Perl, we will have also have a day-long track devoted
to Perl instruction, targeting both people who need to update their
skills or who have never tried Perl before.
</p>

<p>
The DCBPW team is currently actively seeking talks as well as
corporate sponsors for the event. We will be working on a rolling talk
acceptance policy, and the number of speaking slots is limited, so we
encourage early talk submissions. 
</p>

<p>
Registration will cost $25 prior to February 1st, and $50
afterwards. Free admission is available for students and the currently
unemployed. 
</p>

<p>
More details, as well as registration and talk proposal forms, can be
found at the DCBPW website, <http://dcbpw.org>.
</p>

<p>
We hope to see you all in April for a fun day of Perl!
